## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to get familliar with the NOSQL database MongoDB. We worked strictly with back-end data creating routes, controllers, models, and utilities. This was an interesting task as it gave me a different perspective and approach to databases. I think it has its ups and downs comapared to sequelize but overall was enjoyable and not so challenging to learn.
